A LabView application that acquires finite data and performs different forms of mathematical analysis. A little bare in features but this is primarily something I made to practice using as many diffrent features as I could while learning how to use the LabView development environment. The program utilizes state machines, various case structures, signal generation, DAQ assist (done with a simulated DAQ because I don't own one), various data types, file handling, a runtime menu, multiple VIs, property nodes, invoke nodes, error handling, and application building.
